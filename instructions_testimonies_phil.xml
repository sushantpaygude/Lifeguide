          &#8220;When I started using STRONG, I was only able to do activities for a couple of hours every day. As time progressed, I was able to do more with my arm and hand. Seeing the graph going up every day motivated me to do more every day. It felt a little bit like training like an athlete actually!

          I liked doing activities as when you do a real activity, you need to really try to do it and achieve it. And the more you achieve the more you want to do.

          It was nice to feel empowered to plan my own therapy program. I quickly learned how to pick the activities that are at my level and to set realistic goals for myself. Getting encouragement from my relatives and therapist really helped as well.&#8221;
